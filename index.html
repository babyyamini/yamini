    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p> <br> <p> The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your <br>
        choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is <br>
        repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if <br> 
        you didn't, it isn't. <br> <br>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that <br>
        the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its<br>
         children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.<br> <br>
          Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, <br>
             and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, 
        and try <br> another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
        <p>This needs an example</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
            <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
            <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
            <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
            <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
            <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
            <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
